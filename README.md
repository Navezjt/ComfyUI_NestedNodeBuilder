# ComfyUI_NestedNodeBuilder
Adds a feature that allows for nesting of other nodes for better organization and simplification of repetitive patterns in workflows.

## Installation
Enter the following command from the commandline starting in ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
```
git clone https://github.com/ssitu/ComfyUI_ComfyUI_NestedNodeBuilder
```

## Disclaimer
This is a prototype and will likely have many problems. This will probably be obsolete once [subgraphs](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/pull/724) are implemented within ComfyUI.
